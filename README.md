# Codealpha_Language-translator
I built a Python Language Translator that quickly converts text between multiple languages using APIs like Google Translate. It has a simple interface, supports copy-to-clipboard, and offers optional text-to-speech. This project highlights my skills in Python, APIs, and UI design while showing a real use of machine translation.
